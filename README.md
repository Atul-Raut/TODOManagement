# TODO Management
TODO list management application using React Native and Expo.

Right now, we're making new topics/tasks and updating their status as "Doing," "Done," or "Delete" for completed tasks. This helps us stay organized and efficient in our work.

We can add a priority system for topics/tasks, making it easier to manage them based on their importance. Additionally, we'll be able to identify and address any delays.

Also, we can enhance by analyzing and graphically representing the number of tasks created and completed over time. This will provide valuable insights into project progress and efficiency.
